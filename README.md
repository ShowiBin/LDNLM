# Linear Attention Based Deep Nonlocal Means Filtering for Multiplicative Noise Removal

This the python (Pytorch) implementation of the work "Linear Attention Based Deep Nonlocal Means Filtering for Multiplicative Noise Removal". For more details in \link{https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05087}.

## Usage
- You can download the testing SAR image from \link{https://www.dropbox.com/s/4gfkge0pqkuylmv/decorr_complex_tsx_SLC_0.mat?e=1&dl=0}. Put it in this root directory.

- Run the main.py with the checkpoint file LDNLM_best.pt.
